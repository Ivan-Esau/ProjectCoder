# ProjectCoder

This project contains a Flask based application that helps plan and generate code using LLM APIs.

## GitLab Integration

A minimal GitLab CI configuration is provided in `.gitlab-ci.yml`. The pipeline installs dependencies and runs the test suite via `pytest`.

Tickets generated by the application can be pushed to GitLab as issues using the script `scripts/gitlab_issues.py`.

### Creating issues

1. Set the environment variables `GITLAB_TOKEN` and `GITLAB_PROJECT_ID` (and optionally `GITLAB_URL`).
2. Run the script and provide the path to your `tickets.json` file:

```bash
python scripts/gitlab_issues.py path/to/tickets.json
```

Each ticket will be created as an issue in the specified GitLab project.
